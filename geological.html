			  <p class="text">Despite being non-recognizable, the oldest rocks are metamorphic rocks that date back from 1.3 to 1 billion years old, by the Late Proterozoic.&#160;&#160;The rocks would have belonged to a supercontinent called Rodinia.&#160;&#160;About 750-600 million years ago, Rodinia brokeoff when the proto-Pacific Basin was formed.&#160;&#160;The continental blocks of Sino-Korea and Yangtze were formed.&#160;&#160;At this time, the cratons were passive rift margins.</p>

			  <p class="text">About 500 million years ago, the edges of the Sino-Korea and Yangtze became active subduction margins.&#160;&#160;The subduction processes allowed the cratons to become part of the Japanese landmass.</p>

			<p class="text">Volcanic features originating from a superplume were found in the Pathalassa Sea near the Australian continent.&#160;&#160;Between this time and the Permian, then features would travel across the proto-Pacific basin.&#160;&#160;These features would eventually be found in the Akiyoshi and Maizuru Belts.</p>

			<div class="ui bottom attached tab segment" data-tab="Permian">
			<p class="text">The Farallon plate got subducted by the Yangtze craton.&#160;&#160;The subduction resulted in the creation of the Akiyoshi, Maizuru, and Sangun Belts from sediments onto the continental margin.&#160;&#160;The belts were accretioned to the edge of the Yangtze craton.</p>

			<div class="ui bottom attached tab segment" data-tab="Triassic">
			<p class="text">The Sino-Korea and Yangtze collided with each other in polar direction.&#160;&#160;This ended up closing the paleo-Tethys seaway.&#160;&#160;The collision is represented near the Qinling-Dabie mountainous zone in China.&#160;&#160;The Hida and Hitachi-Takanuki belts were exhumed metamorphic belts that formed at the eastern expansion of the collision.&#160;&#160;At the end of this time period, the oceanic ridge between the Farallon and Izanagi Plates moved northwards with the plates.&#160;&#160;This caused the exhumation of the Sangun metamorphic belt.</p>

			<div class="ui bottom attached tab segment" data-tab="Jurassic">
			<p class="text">Around this time, Pangea begins to break up.&#160;&#160;This causes the extension of Tethys Sea ridge to split off, forming the northern (Laurasia) and southern (Gondwana) continental mass.&#160;&#160;The proto-Japan area experienced the accreting of the oceanic floor sediments and the Akasaka-Kuzuu.&#160;&#160;During this time, the Mino-Tanba, Ryouke Chichibu, and N. Kitakami-Oushima accertionary complexes accounted for nearly 50% of the current archipelagic basement.</p>

			<div class="ui bottom attached tab segment" data-tab="Cretaceous">
			<p class="text">The Mikabu and Sorachi plateaus were incorporated into the proto-Japnese landmass.&#160;&#160;During this time, the Izanagi Plate changed its direction to be more northerly.&#160;&#160;This change on the plate produced two results.&#160;&#160;The first result allowed the accretionary complexes formed in the Jurassic to be more in line with modern day Japan.&#160;&#160;The other result was that accretionary and igneous activity were halted.</p>
			<p class="text">The change, however, was not permanent as the Izanagi Plate changed directions again.&#160;&#160;This ended up increasing accertionary activity in the Ryouke Belt, eventually creating the north Shimanto Belt.&#160;&#160;During this time period, Sanbagawa Belt was exhumed gradually from south to north.&#160;&#160;Finally, a new plate formed off the northern edge of the Laurasian continent, containing several landmass that would become the Kamachatka Peninsula.</p>

			<p class="text">There were several fossils that originate from the Cretaceous: </p>
			<ul class="ui list">
				<li class="text">Phosphorosaurus ponpetelegans</li>
				<li class="text">Fukuiraptor kitadanensis</li>
				<li class="text">Fukuititan nipponensis (see above)</li>
				<li class="text">Fukuivenator paradoxus</li>
				<li class="text">Theropoda</li>
				<li class="text">Sauropods</li>

			<div class="ui bottom attached tab segment" data-tab="Cenozoic">
			<p class="text">Japan underwent several structural modifications during the Cenozoic period.&#160;&#160;These modifications eventually became to be known as modern Japan.</p>
			<p class="text">First, during the Eocene, was the formation of the oceanic Philippine Plate and the Izu Arc.&#160;&#160;In the Miocene, upwelling under the eastern Eurasian continent caused rifts in the continetal crust.&#160;&#160;These rifts eventually formed the Lake Baikal and Bohai Basin.&#160;&#160;However, the Japan and Kurile Sea basins split apart and the basin floor flooded with magma, creating oceanic-type crust.&#160;&#160;This created the Japanese and Kurile archipelagos.&#160;&#160;</p>
			<p class="text">Around this time, the two portions of Japan split off from the continent and created a "double door" effect, opening the Japan Sea Basin.&#160;&#160;The sea eventually stopped opening further due to encountering the Ize Arc.&#160;&#160;The earliest dated and westernmost geological belts, Hida and Oki, formed.</p>
			<p class="text">Additionally, the Median Tectonic Line (MTL) and the Tanakura Tectonic Line (TTL) originated around this time period.&#160;&#160;The MTL runs east-west through southwestern Japan and TTL runs north-south in northeastern Japan.&#160;&#160;Fragments of the Hida and Oki belts were moved into the Touhoku region, positioning the Hitachi-Takanuki and the Southern Kitakami Belts.</p>
			<p class="text">Finally, the fragments of Hokkaido aligned with Japan, occurring about 15 million years ago.&#160;&#160;This becomes the recognizable Japan we know of today.</p>
			<p class="text">Biological:</p>
			<p class="text">The Dainichi Formation contains some molluscan fossils.  The formation dates back from the Pliocene.</p>
			<p class="text">The Iwaki Formation is known to have three mammalian fossil families:</p>
			<ul class="ui list">
				<li class="text">Anthracotheriidae - Hippopotamus-like animals.</li>
				<li class="text">Entelodontidae - Known as hell pigs.</li>
				<li class="text">Ruminantia - Contains the Hypertragulidae</li>
